    "### Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "__Simple__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English, although verystrict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to theproblem rather than the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Easy to Learn__\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has an extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Free and Open Source__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libr√© and Open Source Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of thissoftware, read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of acommunity which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is constantlyimproved by a community who just want to see a better Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "__High-level Language__\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as managing the memory used byyour program, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Portable__\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make it work on) many platforms. All your Pythonprograms can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390,z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!\n",
    "You can even use a platform like Kivy to create games for your computer and for iPhone, iPad, and Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Interpreted__\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires a bit of explanation. A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language thatis spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options. When you run theprogram, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just run the program directly from the source code.Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes and then translates this into the nativelanguage of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don't have to worryabout compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Pythonprograms much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another computer and it just works!\n",
    "\n",
    "__Object Oriented__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In procedure-oriented languages, theprogram is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In object-oriented languages,the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but simplistic way of doingOOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Extensible__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that partof your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Embeddable__\n",
    "\n",
    "You can embed Python within your C/C++ programs to give scripting capabilities for your program's users.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Extensive Libraries__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular expressions,documentationgeneration, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files,cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available whereverPython is installed. This is called the Batteries Included philosophy of Python.Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries which you can find at the Python Package Index.\n",
    "\n",
    " __Summary__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right combination of performance and features that make writingprograms in Python both fun and easy."

    "### Variable\n",
    "Using just literal constants can soon become boring - we need some way of storing any information and manipulate them as well.This is where variables come into the picture. Variables are exactly what the name implies - their value can vary, i.e., you can store anything using a variable. Variables are just parts of your computer's memory where you store some information. Unlike literal constants, you need some method of accessing these variables and hence you give them names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifier Naming\n",
    "Variables are examples of identifiers. _Identifiers_ are names given to identify _something_. There are some rules you have to followfor naming identifiers:\n",
    "- The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "- The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character),underscores (_) or digits (0-9).\n",
    "- Identifier names are case-sensitive. For example, myname and myName are not the same. Note the lowercase n in theformer and the uppercase N in the latter.\n",
    "- Examples of valid identifier names are i, name_2_3. Examples of invalid identifier names are 2things, this isspaced out, my-name and >a1b2_c3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",

    "The length and breadth of the rectangle are stored in variables by the same name. We use these to calculate the area and perimeterof the rectangle with the help of expressions. We store the result of the expression `length * breadth` in the variable `area` andthen print it using the `print` function. In the second case, we directly use the value of the expression `2 * (length + breadth)` in the print function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice how Python pretty-prints the output. Even though we have not specified a space between `'Area is'` and the variable `area`, Python puts it for us so that we get a clean nice output and the program is much more readable this way (since wedon't need to worry about spacing in the strings we use for output). This is an example of how Python makes life easy for the programmer.\n",

    "We have seen how to use operators, operands and expressions - these are the basic building blocks of any program. Next, we willsee how to make use of these in our programs using statements."
